Your task is to extract all funding entities and their associated grant details from a single funding statement. You must carefully identify each funder, their grant IDs, and any specific, named funding schemes mentioned in the text.

Return the result as a structured list of objects. Each object in the list should represent a distinct funder and contain the following fields:
- `funder_name`: The name of the funding organization.
- `funding_scheme`: The specific name of the funding program or scheme. This field will be `null` in almost all cases.
- `award_ids`: A list of all grant numbers or identifiers associated with the funder.
- `award_title`: The title of the award, if explicitly provided.

### Detailed Instructions and Rules:

1.  **Funder Identification (`funder_name`):**
  *   **Use Literal Names:** Extract the funder's name exactly as it appears in the text. Do not use external knowledge to expand acronyms. For example, if the text says \"NSF\", the `funder_name` is \"NSF\", not \"National Science Foundation\" (unless the full name is also provided in the text).
  *   **Capture Full Hierarchical Names:** If a funder is described with a specific sub-division, department, or office (e.g., \"US Department of Energy, Fusion Energy Sciences\"), capture this entire, more specific name as the `funder_name`. Do not split parts of it into the `funding_scheme`.
  *   **Identify All Involved Parties:** In complex statements, multiple entities may be considered funders.
      *   For phrases like \"...carried out within the framework of the **EUROfusion Consortium**, funded by the **European Union**...\", both \"EUROfusion Consortium\" and \"European Union\" should be extracted as separate funders.
      *   Extract organizations mentioned in related disclaimers, even if they are being absolved of responsibility (e.g., from \"...Neither the European Union nor the **European Commission** can be held responsible...\", extract \"European Commission\" as a funder).
  *   **Consolidate Duplicates:** If the exact same funder is mentioned multiple times, create only one object for it and aggregate all its associated `award_ids`.
  
  2.  **Funding Scheme (`funding_scheme`):**
  *   **This is a critical instruction. This field must be `null` in the vast majority of cases.**
  *   This field is reserved **ONLY** for the **proper name** of a specific, standalone funding program that is clearly distinct from the funder's name and its internal structure.
  *   **Crucial Exclusions:** The following are **NOT** funding schemes and must result in a `null` value:
      *   **Generic Terms:** \"grant\", \"project\", \"award\", \"support\", \"funding\", \"fellowship\", \"scholarship\", \"contract\", \"Open Access funding\".
      *   **Parts of a Funder's Name:** A program name that is part of a funder's hierarchical description is part of the `funder_name`, not the `funding_scheme`.
          *   *Example*: For \"US Department of Energy, Fusion Energy Sciences\", the `funder_name` is \"US Department of Energy, Fusion Energy Sciences\" and `funding_scheme` is `null`. \"Fusion Energy Sciences\" is NOT a scheme.
      *   **Funding Mechanisms:** A program name that describes the mechanism through which funding is delivered is not a scheme.
          *   *Example*: For \"...funded by the European Union via the Euratom Research and Training Programme...\", \"Euratom Research and Training Programme\" is NOT a scheme and should be ignored. The `funder_name` is \"European Union\" and its `funding_scheme` is `null`.
          
  3.  **Award IDs (`award_ids`):**
  *   Extract all alphanumeric codes that represent grant numbers, contract numbers, or project identifiers.
  *   Accurately associate each ID with its correct funder. For example, in \"...EUROfusion Consortium... (Grant Agreement No 101052200...)\", \"101052200\" should be associated with \"EUROfusion Consortium\".
  *   A single funder can have multiple `award_ids`. Collect them all into a single list for that funder.
  
  4.  **Award Title (`award_title`):**
  *   Only extract a value for this field if a specific title for the grant or project is explicitly stated, typically in quotation marks.
  *   *Example*: For \"...under the contract No. APVV-15-0604 entitled 'Reduction of fecundity...'\", the `award_title` would be 'Reduction of fecundity...'.
  *   In most cases, this field will be `null`.
  
  5.  **General Approach:**
  *   Parse the entire statement carefully, paying close attention to prepositions like \"by\", \"via\", and \"within\".
  *   Create one object per unique funder identified.
  *   Aggregate all awards for a single funder into its corresponding `award_ids` list.
  *   Do not extract acknowledgements to individuals as funders.
