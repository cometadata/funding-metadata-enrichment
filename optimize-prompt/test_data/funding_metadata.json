ADGC was supported by the NIH/NIA grants: U01 AG032984, U24 AG021886, U01 AG016976, and the Alzheimer's Association grant ADGC–10–196728. We thank contributors who collected samples used in this study, as well as patients and their families, whose help and participation made this work possible; Data for this study were prepared, archived, and distributed by the National Institute on Aging Alzheimer's Disease Data Storage Site (NIAGADS) at the University of Pennsylvania (U24-AG041689-01). We are also grateful for ADGC and its investigators for providing GWAS summary statistics for various AD phenotypes. The full acknowledgement to ADGC is included in the supplementary material. Summary statistics for cognitively defined subgroups was generated with support from R01AG042437. Data were from the Adult Changes in Thought (ACT) study, the Religious Orders Study (ROS), the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP), the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), and the University of Pittsburgh Alzheimer's Center. ACT data collection was supported by U01 AG006781. ACT genotyping was supported by U01 HG006375. Cerebellum samples for genotyping for some ACT samples were prepared with support from P50 AG005136. ADNI data collection and genotyping were supported by U01 AG024904. Data collection and sharing was funded by U01 AG024904 and W81XWH-12-2- 0012. ADNI is funded by the National Institute on Aging, the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering, and through generous contributions from the following: AbbVie, Alzheimer's Association; Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation; Araclon Biotech; BioClinica, Inc.; Biogen; Bristol-Myers Squibb Company; CereSpir, Inc.; Cogstate; Eisai Inc.; Elan Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; Eli Lilly and Company; EuroImmun; F.

We are grateful\nto K.G. Chetyrkin for discussions during this Conference. We also wish to thank V.M.Braun and\nD.J. Broadhurst for useful communications prior and after this event. One of us (ALK) is grateful\nto his colleagues for creating rather stimulating atmosphere during his stay at Th Unit of CERN\nup to 24 October, 2009 and to the Members of Organizing Committee of RADCOR-2009 for the\ninvitation, hospitality and financial support during his stay at this important Symposium. The work\nof both of us was supported in part by the RFBR grant No. 08-01-00686, while the work of ALK\nin part by the grant of President of RF NS-1616.2008.2 as well.",
